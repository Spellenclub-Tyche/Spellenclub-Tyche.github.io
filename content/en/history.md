Tyche is an initiative started by Uilenstede residents who noticed that there is a lot to do in the Amsterdam / Amstelveen area for people who want more than just studying or working. There are sports clubs, entertainment venues, and places where you can take creative courses. Unfortunately, there were almost no board game clubs.

Yes, if you played Magic or another popular game, you could often find a place. However, if you just wanted to play a game with (new) people, were looking for fellow players for Catan, wanted to try out a new game (before possibly buying it), or had made something yourself that you wanted to try out, there was nowhere to go.

At the beginning of this century, a couple of game enthusiasts living in Uilenstede decided to start a board game club. And Tyche was born!

For the first twenty years, we played at the Griffioen Cultural Center in Uilenstede.

It had been known for several years that the Griffioen wanted to move to the VU campus itself and that there would unfortunately be no place for us. Then, at the beginning of 2020, Covid came into play. During the less strict lockdowns, we could play with a small group of eight to twelve people on Monday evenings in De Griffioen. Fortunately, one of us was a teacher at the HWC, and after the Covid pandemic, we were allowed to play in the teachers' lounge on Monday evenings. Most Mondays, we have twelve to sixteen board game players who come to play a game.

Since September 2023, there has also been a dedicated BotC (Blood on the Clocktower) game group on Monday evenings.

In January 2025 we completely renewed our website, which is the one you are currenly reading. [Click here to see the old website](/old_site/).
