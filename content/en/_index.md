## Who are we?

Tyche currently plays almost every Monday night in the teachers' lounge of the Herman Wesselink College (HWC). With a few exceptions due to special school activities or Easter and Pentecost.

## Summer Break 2025

Tyche will also be playing during the summer break (July 12th to August 24th) on Monday evenings at Herman Wesselink College. Generally, from 7:00 PM to 10:45 PM, unless otherwise communicated.

It's helpful to let us know you're coming (you can simply email us). And make sure you arrive by 7:00 PM. That way, someone can let you in and show you the way.
